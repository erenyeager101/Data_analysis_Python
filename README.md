### 4️⃣ **Weather data prediction using Logistic Regression in Excel**  
   - **Description:** Sourced Government datasets on weather for Pune city , cleaned it processed it in excel. Used categorical data as depndent variable and predicted certain factors like rainfalll, high temp days etc.
   - **Tech Stack:** `Excel`, `Logistic regression`
   - **Key Highlights:**
     - Built a Logistic regression model from scratch in Excel and Solver
     - Analyzed over 15 different fields and selectd the most dominating factors from them
     - Got accuracy of 78% initially then cleaned my dtaset a bit and removed outliers and applied NRG in solver to get 91% accuravcy significant increase in accuracy.
